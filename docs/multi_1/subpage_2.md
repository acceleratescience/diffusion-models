There are a few popular ways to publish documentation for your project. Here, we will use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), but another popular framework is [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.com). MkDocs is highly customizable, has good support, and is used by many companies around the world. This site was created with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
